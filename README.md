# FSEconomy styles script

Override some FSE styles to make it look less dated. 

The objective is to let your browser inject some CSS (that controls how things look in the browser) and Javascript to make the job of the CSS more easy. This will override FSE's styles making it look different. 

This will not upload anything to FSE, just change how it looks *on your browser*. If you move to a different browser (e.g. your phone) you won't see any of this. It's all local to your machine and browser.

## How to use

I use a Chrome extension called **User JavaScript and CSS** to inject the CSS and JS: 
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/user-javascript-and-css/nbhcbdghjpllgmfilhnhkllmkecfmpld

* Once the extension is installed, download the most recent `.json` file from the list above (currently user-js-css-v8-220421.json)
* Open your extension settings. Under "Settings > Backup" you'll see an option to to `Upload and apply`. Give it the json file you have just downloaded, and it will set it up for you. 
* Go back to the _Sites_ tab and make sure `FSEconomy server` is active 

## How do I turn it off?

While browsing FSE's server click on the extension. You'll see a toggle to turn it off. Or uninstall the extension :) 

## What about other extensions?

Maybe you prefer to use Greasemonkey, Violentmonkey or other extension, please feel free and let me know how it works. That's why I have uploaded 2 separate files with the CSS and the JS respectively, so you can use whatever you want.

Maybe in the future I'd move to one of those if it's easier to share.
